    "This repo consists of a walkthrough for creating a dataset of protein sequences in a similar fashion as was done by [Zhou & Troyanskaya, 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.1347.pdf). The authors of that paper used a dataset constructed as outlined below to train convolutional generative stochastic networks for protein secondary structure prediction (PSSP). The modest goal is to introduce individuals with experience in machine/deep learning to the basics of structural bioinformatics by constructing a dataset for PSSP as well as other, related tasks."

    "Proteins are one of the most important classes of macromolecules in biology. They are composed of linear chains of 20 (sometimes 22) proteinogenic amino acids. Each amino acid can be represented by a single letter, allowing us to express proteins as a string. For example, the sequence for hemoglobin is:\n",

    "When found in the appropriate biological context, proteins assume - through a complex interplay of physicochemical forces - a 3-dimensional conformation, referred to as the protein's *tertiary* or *native* structure. This native state determines how a particular protein behaves; that is, form determines function. Accurately predicting tertiary structure is therefore the first and most fundamental step for understanding the function of discovered proteins as well as for designing new proteins with entirely novel functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the folding process, regions along the protein backbone assume local conformations called secondary structures. These secondary structures are characterized by the patterns of hydrogen bonds formed between amino acids in a particular region. One common way of categorizing such structures is given by the dictionary of protein secondary structires [DSSP](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/). Since nearly all secondary structures are localized to a particular region of the backbone, they can also be written as a string of letters, where each letter corresponds to a particular secondary structure. Hemoglobin, aligned with its secondary structures, is as follows:\n",
